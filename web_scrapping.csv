0,Aman More,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good daily driver.,"  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
1,Abhishek Agarwal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad bad camera,"  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
2,Kiran KS,4.0 out of 5 stars,The original segment of One Plus,"  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
3,Nikhil,5.0 out of 5 stars,*Read before you buy!!*,"  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.‚Ä¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatüòÖ‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.‚Ä¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here‚úåÔ∏è*UPDATED*‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
4,Deblina Roy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don‚Äôt panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don‚Äôt  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"

6,Sreeram,1.0 out of 5 stars,Totally dissatisfied. No AR support.,"  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
7,aishwarya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price!,"  An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
8,Sudeshna Dey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad front camera,"  Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"

10,Praggya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Think and evaluate before you go for it,"  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)"

16,KESH,1.0 out of 5 stars,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.,"  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.

21,Manpreet Singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but always with some screen and body issues!,"  I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.",OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)

28,SK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera,"  Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!",OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)
29,Vikas Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,best and most reliable phone at this price,"  I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5.1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing.2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging.3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth.4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing.5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins.6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear.7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good.Conclusion: No phone is perfect.

33,PRABAHARAN,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just Read before buying. My opinion,  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.Pros:Design and built quality - superb.Display - Smoothness and view is very impressiveFinger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.Rear camera - Good as considering the price.Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.Call quality very fineCons:Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.Macro camera - useless featureFront camera - AverageUi is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).FinalNormal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day).

It was completely dead no power in mobileI received a defect piece then I try to return the mobile nobody is coming for pickup from Amazon and no refund option.Buying mobile in Amazon is a worst decision.So again after multiple follow ups someone From Amazon picked up the phone to return but it's not updated yet in app Or no further communication has been updated from Amazon. I called Amazon customer service care for the the same... He was like just woke up from sleep(mooning) and asked me to wait for on hold and he never came back to talk to me.

41,Ajay KS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.,"  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.","Samsung Galaxy M31 Prime Edition (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Get Complementary 3 month Prime Membership"

43,Riddham Jain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","Samsung Galaxy M31 Prime Edition (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Get Complementary 3 month Prime Membership"

45,Abhinav,1.0 out of 5 stars,Serious Issue,"  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.","Samsung Galaxy M31 Prime Edition (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Get Complementary 3 month Prime Membership"

50,Alok Mishra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Average Phone. Critical review for Samsung so that they develop better features,"  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.","Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"

54,Nitesh Bajpai,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best phones at affordable price...,"  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage","Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
55,ishan gautam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this product. Even the most basic things are faulty,"  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone.

I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average","Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"

I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !!

65,Krusshna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy it from this seller,"  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren‚Äôt working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren‚Äôt working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don‚Äôt regret after.","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Black (Includes EarPods, Power Adapter)"

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet üòù  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol ü§ó And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ‚ú®",Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green

78,Chiranjit Das,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today,"  I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone:What I didnt like:1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone.2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos.3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms.Now about what I love in this phone:1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus.2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights.3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones.4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever.5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change.Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.",Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green

89,vignesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,not worth for money,"  This phone is not worth for 28k, performance is very bad. After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review.1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.  A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.  B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.  C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue.Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good.Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 1 for 5Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone. All the above complaints works randomly, I had screen recored and shots for proof to show.","Vivo V19 (Mystic Silver, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers"
